# Phobos Framework changelog

Maintained from 25 September 2026. Earlier development versions are documented
in the project research and guides; no complete historical release log is claimed.
Dates on Draft entries record preparation, not Steam publication.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Shared native INSTALL category constants and pre-publication validation prevent unreachable visible installation entries.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-09-25 - Draft

### Added

- Bounded multi-receiver port banks retain the original single-pair identity.
- Reusable retained two-component fluid lines preserve cargo, route binding and transit clocks across reloads.
- Bounded hydraulic resistance and shared-budget allocation support Agriculture and optional furnace coolant servicing.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-09-25 - Draft

### Development baseline

- Initial changelog baseline for the current source; this version has not been published to Steam.
- Native construction, maintenance, additive merchant stock and material accounting.
- Versioned saved state, physical transfers, explicit endpoint pairing and ship-scoped equipment controls.
- Measured power and liquid delivery, shared conduit routes, finite solution accounting and optional provider adapters.
- Translation lookup, reusable native instruments and opt-in Phobos Scope performance recording.

### Requirements

Ostranauts 1.0.1.5 and BepInEx 5 (inspected baseline 5.4.23.5). No Shipbreaker, Crafting Framework or Salvage Workshop dependency.

### Known limits

- This is an experimental shared library. Successful offline checks do not establish in-game compatibility.
- Phobos Scope recording is disabled by default. The recorder is bundled; no Rust process is needed during play.
